# Deforesation_Exploration_and_Analysis
The objective of this project was to use SQL to query data provided by a company named ForestQuery, and create a report of findings and recommendations for the leadership team to help them understand the global deforestation overview between 1990 and 2016.

## Background

ForestQuery, a ficitional non-profit organization, is on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and raises awareness about this important environmental topic.

The executive director and leadership team members were looking to understand which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size, and also which countries and regions have the most significant forest area, both in terms of amount and percent of total area. The hope is that these findings can help inform initiatives, communications, and personnel allocation to achieve the largest impact with the precious few resources that the organization has at its disposal.
